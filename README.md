# Portfolio

This is my second portfolio. My first portfolio can be found [here](https://github.com/jekiquin/portfolio).

I decided not to use any of frontend framework to build this site (with the exception of PhaserJS and ThreeJS) as it will just be a static website.

There will be some user interactivity for this site so it is recommended to have javascript enabled on the browser.

Site is also usable even when JavaScript is disabled.

## Stacks

- HTML
- SASS
- Javascript
- ThreeJS
- PhaserJS
- Vite

## Development

1. Requirements
   - Node >= 16
   - Yarn (preferred)
2. Instructions

   - Install the packages

     `yarn`

   - Run development server with Vite bundling

     `yarn dev`

- Build and preview production copy of bundle

  `yarn start`
