# Portfolio

This is my second portfolio. My first portfolio can be found [here](https://github.com/jekiquin/portfolio).

I decided not to use any of frontend framework to build this site (with the exception of PhaserJS) as it will just be a static website.

There will be some user interactivity for this site so it is recommended to have javascript enabled on the browser.

## Stacks

- HTML
- SASS
- Javascript
- PhaserJS

## Development

1. Requirements
   - Node >= 16
   - Yarn (preferred)
2. Instructions

   - Install the packages

     `yarn`

   - Run development to convert sass to css

     `yarn dev`
